## Source Files

The branding was created in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), so layered files are created in the vector `.sketch` format.

## Styleguide

The project typography uses the [Varela Rounded](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round) typeface created by [Avraham Cornfeld]https://github.com/avrahamcornfeld/Varela-Round-Hebrew), which is made available under the [Open Font License](https://github.com/avrahamcornfeld/Varela-Round-Hebrew/blob/master/OFL.txt).

The set of colors for Krustlet include a primary palette (dark blue, dark green) for key elements, and secondary palette for decorative/shading purposes (light green, light blue and orange).

These colors should be used sparingly for clean layouts. Here are some example uses:
